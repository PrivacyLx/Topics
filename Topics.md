Unfortunately I lost the content of this file, but here are some ideas:


## Censorship Simulation

## Facebook Rehabilitation Group

## Demistifying Encryption

## Playing With google algorithms
* Create a new identity on the web and try to reach a certain profile. Example: female, likes makeup, etc. And see the adds for that

## Digital Miror
Make people see what advertising companies think they are and compare with other people. Use a script that takes pictures of the adds shown to each of us and comparte them. Maybe some will not even like that they are shared because they are so personal. And it is an oppportunity to show people how much information these companies have on you.
