# Ideas for Topics
These are just some ideas of topics we are interested on covering. So they just sit here until someone decides to pick it up. You can think about it as a bucket of ideas. Feel free to share, remix however you like and contribute if you have something interesting in mind. You can do that as a pull request or if you don't have a github account e-mail one of the organizers at francisco.core.at.protonmail.com.

When the idea is getting bigger than a small description, you can create a new directory like "Topics/name-of-your-idea" and expand it as much as you would like in there, add images, presentations, etc. And then add a link from this document to your other one.

**Feel free to use any of these ideas on workshops of yours !**

## Investigating Metadata colletion by the PT Govt
The european union passed a law that was considered later considered to be against the fundamental rights of the citizen. The law [find source]() mandated that telecom provides recorded metadata for two years. But since it was a directive, it was implemented in every country's laws and when it was conidered illegal, it was already too late. Now the law has to be abolished in every single EU country's tribunals. In Portugal the law [was apparently considered inconstitutional](https://dre.pt/home/-/dre/70300353/details/maximized). But then it seems that a [loophole](https://dre.pt/pesquisa/-/search/108052020/details/normal) allowed for the continuation of that collection and use. We should investigate a bit more on this.

## Censorship Simulation
Create a censored environment with various levels of censorship:
  * DNS censorship - people will have to change the DNS
  * IP Blocking    - use tor or some sort of VPN
  * Tor is Blocked - people will have to use bridges
  * Deep Packet Inspection - obsfproxy

The ideia is for people in understand that there are various types of censorship and know how to get around them. It would also be valuable to explain what kinds of censorship are in use in particular countries.


## Facebook Rehabilitation Group
Facebook is made to be addictive and the fear of missing out is a huge psychological effect that keeps people locked into the platform. We should enable a discussion where people talk about the issues that keep them locked on the platoform and what can be done to help them leave it.


## Demystifying Encryption
For many people encryption is a buzz word for security and it is some sort of magic bullet that solves everything. In reality there are different kinds of encryption and it important for us to know how to differentiate the. Even more than that, it is important to ask the right questions about that technology. Questions such as:
  * Who has access to the data
  * Who controlls the keys
  * Is it open and well documented?
  * Is the technology standardized?

## Playing With google algorithms
Create a new identity on the web and try to reach a certain profile. Example: female, likes makeup, or male that gets adds about watches, etc. And see the adds for that

## Digital Miror
Make people see what advertising companies think they are and compare with other people. Use a script that takes pictures of the adds shown to each of us and comparte them. Maybe some will not even like that they are shared because they are so personal. And it is an oppportunity to show people how much information these companies have on you.

## QubesOS meetup
QuebesOS is an awesome Operating System and it deserves to have people chat about it. So let's share your experiences with it and introduce new people to the concept of compartmentalization at the operationg system level.

## Breaking Windows Tea Party
Let's break away from Windows. Let's install software that promotes freedom and gives us power instead. In this workshop, we shall guide people on the adventure of venturing to a new operating system. There will be chanllenges ahead, but the destination is a much better place and well worth the turbulent trip. So let's sail to that island together and help eachother with our difficulties.

## Monthly Privacy Cafe
Gather people around the topics of surveillance and privacy on an informal encounter.

## Investigating Large Databases
We know that in europe as well as around the world there are huge dataset from people all around the world. We should do a working session to find what these are at leas so we have some notion of what is going on.

## Snowden Docs Investigation
It has been some years now, but the Snowden documents still contain relevant information. We should do a working session where we analyze these documents.



## Tracking the Trackers

Taking a look at the marketing industry, look for catalogs and the stuff they sell. Because their websites look like they went straight out of Brave New World.



## Tracking Ourselves and Each-other

Peer-surveillance is when someone surveils or tracks others within the same circles. Think of parents tracking their children (look for US patent 2016/0183693 A1 Google), people tracking their health data, foursquare



## Understanding the Surveillance by Looking at Patents

* US patent 2016/0183693 A1 Google 
* Facebook patent on tacking people on supermarkets
* Look for facebook's other companies

Maybe do a presentation on the most distopian patents. Maybe do a contest of the patents in a workshop where we choose the worst one (big-brother award-like)





## Insecurity Demonstrations Mini-Hackathons

One typical problem with explaining to people how deep the privacy violations go is because in tech, everything is kind of invisible. The purpose of these sessions is for us to collaborate on tools that help people visualize what is going on in the background.
