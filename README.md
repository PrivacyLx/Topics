# Ideas for Topics


## Censorship Simulation
Create a censored environment with various levels of censorship:
  * DNS censorship - people will have to change the DNS
  * IP Blocking    - use tor or some sort of VPN
  * Tor is Blocked - people will have to use bridges
  * Deep Packet Inspection - obsfproxy

The ideia is for people in understand that there are various types of censorship and know how to get around them. It would also be valuable to explain what kinds of censorship are in use in particular countries.

Questions such as:
  * Who has access to the data
  * Who controlls the keys
  * Is it open and well documented?
  * Is the technology standardized?
